AI Reading Assistant for Dyslexic Learners
# AI Dyslexia Reading Assistant

This project presents an AI-driven assistive learning system designed to support dyslexic learners in improving reading fluency, attention, and engagement through multimodal interaction. The goal of the platform is to simulate a personalized learning environment where speech processing, computer vision, and adaptive machine learning work together to provide dynamic guidance and feedback to struggling readers.

The application begins with real-time speech analysis, converting spoken audio into text using modern automatic speech recognition. Mispronunciations, skipped words, and disruptions to fluency are identified, enabling the system to offer instant corrective feedback and measure reading accuracy. To complement speech evaluation, the platform uses a webcam-based attention monitoring component powered by OpenCV face and eye tracking. This module estimates focus duration, blink rate, and rough gaze direction to detect signs of distraction or fatigue during reading sessions, ensuring the learner remains actively engaged.

The platform features a difficulty adaptation engine that models reading performance using a regression-based scoring approach that accounts for pronunciation, focus, and reading speed. Based on these insights, the system intelligently adjusts the complexity of words and sentences, as well as the level of assistance required by the user. To enhance decoding support, a multisensory learning layer integrates visual cues, such as syllable highlighting, with audio guidance through text-to-speech narration, reinforcing connections between printed text and phonetic sound patterns.

A personalized mentor persona plays a crucial role in supporting motivation and confidence throughout the reading journey. Instead of providing generic feedback, the assistant responds empathetically with tone-appropriate guidance tailored to the student’s progress, suggesting improvement strategies and celebrating achievements. Over time, the system maintains a performance history that feeds into a learning dashboard, allowing both the learner and educators to track improvements in reading ability and attention consistency.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical yet impactful integration of speech technology, computer vision, behavioral analytics, and adaptive learning techniques to create an inclusive educational tool. By combining real-time assessment with emotional intelligence and motivational support, the AI Dyslexia Reading Assistant promotes better learning outcomes and helps dyslexic students build confidence in their reading skills at their own pace.
